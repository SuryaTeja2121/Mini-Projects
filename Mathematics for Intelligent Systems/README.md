Implemted Total Variation Minimization technqiue using a popular and powerful optimization algorithm called ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers).
Implemented the above uisng Python, and we were able to successfully reduce the noisy area of a signal.
Applications â€“ Can be used in the denoising of images and speech signals.

For a better understanding of my project, I recommend going through the Project Report and the Jupyter Notebook file attached above.
